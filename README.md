I update the whole structure of repository.

1.- 'PSO' saves the whole PSO code, and I will update it at this position. 

2.- 'data' saves the best simulation electrode signal of each PSO. 

3.- 'log' saves the log file of each PSO, each txt file including the description of the whole PSO
    and execution time, velocity, best local position, best global position, fitting result and
    random r1, r2(they multiply the vector difference of local and global position, which can random 
    modify the unpdate value of velocity) of each iteration.
